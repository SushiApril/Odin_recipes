    <h2> Description </h2>
    This wow-worthy dish is inspired by an appetizer I once had at a restaurant and couldn't stop dreaming out. This recipe is a bit more challenging than your average egg dish, but tasting the crispy outer crust next to the smooth, silky yolk is worth all the effort! You can garnish with whatever toppings you want, but pickled red onions will offer a pop of brightness to cut through the richness.
